<h2>Design Process</h2>

<p>We utilized Adobe XD to plan out a wireframe at first as we felt it was important to communicate our ideas and concepts with each other even though a wireframe submission is not required this time around. Furthermore, communication is even more important in the creation of PokePlanner as we were split into front and back-end developers. While creating PokePlanner, we ensured each portion of code we were working on was responsive so we did not have to revisit them in the future when we should be validating our code.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

1. Character Selection<br>
We intend to allow users to pick their character/avatar from 4 initial pokemon from PokeAPI as to allow for a greater degree of customization as they progress through our webiste. These characters 'evolve' at levels 10 and 20 similar to a Pokemon Evolution.

2. Tasks <br>
Since PokePlanner is a productivity website, tasks are crucial as it allows the user to keep track of their work and also gives them a sense of accomplishment when a task is finished. We utilized restDB to incorporate account authentication and to also keep track of all the user's tasks.

3. Calendar <br>


<h3>Future Features</h3>

1. PokePlanner can be improved in some ways such as allowing the Skill Tree(PokeSkills) to be customizable and not only be limited to the four modules included in the current build of the website. Though, this would require extensive work both front and back-end.

2. An inventory could also be added to allow users to showcase their acquired items from the rewards/shop menu in home.html. 



<h2>Testing</h2>

<P> Testing is very important in all sorts of programming and especially in web development. Since our website could be deployed on a broad range of devices with varying resolutions, we tried our best to make it as responsive as possible. Furthermore, since PokePlanner relies on restDB and PokeAPI, it is crucial we test that the database, front-end and back-end are functioning correctly. We have put PokePlanner through various validators which are listed below to ensure users have an optimal experience.</p>




<h3>Online Validators Used</h3>




<h3>Devices and Resolutions Used</h3>

* XPS 13 9300 - 1920 x 1080
* XPS 13 9300 - 1920 x 1200


<h3>Browsers Used<h3>

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge


<h3>Possible Problems</h3>

* PokeAPI had a daily rate limit of 300 requests per resource per IP address. We believe this is more than sufficient but it should be noted that if one was to consistently "spam" the GET requests by visiting the webpage many, many times a day, the limit may be hit causing certain images to not be initialized properly.
