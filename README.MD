<h2>Description</h2>

PokePlanner allows users to track their habits and set goals for themselves all while having fun. This is done by gamifying the concept using images and data from PokeAPI as a vast amount of people recognize and find Pocket Monsters entertaining.





<h2>Design Process</h2>

We utilized Adobe XD to plan out a wireframe at first as we felt it was important to communicate our ideas and concepts with each other even though a wireframe submission is not required this time around. 




<h2>Features</h2>

1. Character Selection<br>
We intend to allow users to pick their character/avatar from 4 initial pokemon from PokeAPI as to allow for a greater degree of customization as they progress through our webiste.

2. Daillies <br>
